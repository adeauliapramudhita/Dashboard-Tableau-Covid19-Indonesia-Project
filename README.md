# Dashboard-Tableau-Covid19-Indonesia-Project
The COVID-19 in Indonesia Dataset, compiled by Hendratno, gathers data from covid19.go.id, kemendagri.go.id, and bps.go.id. It tracks the pandemic timeline, covering active cases, mortality, and recovery rates. Sourced from Kaggle, it spans March 2020 – September 2022, but analysis focuses on September 2020 – September 2022.
