# Dashboard-Tableau-Covid19-Indonesia-Project
The COVID-19 in Indonesia Dataset is a compilation of various open data sources, including covid19.go.id (pandemic data), kemendagri.go.id (demographic data), bps.go.id (demographic data), and several derived calculations based on these data relationships. This dataset contains a time series of COVID-19 pandemic events across various provinces in Indonesia.

The COVID-19 in Indonesia Dataset is used to analyze the latest active case rates, mortality rates, and recovery rates of COVID-19 in different regions of Indonesia. It was compiled by Hendratno and obtained from Kaggle. The dataset covers the number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia from March 2020 to September 2022. However, in the data analysis conducted, only COVID-19 case data for a precise two-year period from September 2020 to September 2022 will be used.
